Guess the Number Game
Tianpei Xu, Matrikulation number: 3152721

Purpose

The purpose of this program is to provide a simple guessing game in which users try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The program provides feedback to the user as to whether their guess was too high or too low and records how many guesses it took to find the correct answer, as well as the time spent playing and the highest score of the three games. The program also allows the user to exit the game at any time.


How to use the program

To use the program, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
You can then download an IDE to run the code, such as PyCharm.

4. The program will prompt you to guess a number between 1 and 100. Enter a number or type 'q' to exit the game.

5. You will play the next three games to tally the highest score. The program will provide feedback on whether your guess was too high or too low. Keep guessing until you guess the correct number or quit the game. Each time you guess, you will be given feedback on the number of times and the time taken.

6.After three games, the program will give you the highest score and a list of scores, the highest score being: the least number of correct guesses
